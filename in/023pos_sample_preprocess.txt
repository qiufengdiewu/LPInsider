Xist	SPEN	Xist silence transcription by directly interact with SPEN recruit SMRT activate HDAC3 and deacetylating histone to exclude Pol II across the X chromosome 	
Xist	Atrx	Atrx unexpectedly function a a high-affinity RNA-binding protein that directly interact with RepA Xist RNA to promote loading of PRC2 in vivo 	
Xist	EZH2	EZH2 interact with HOTAIR and Xist 	
Xist	HNRNPU	HNRNPU Directly Interacts with Xist RNA via RGG RNA-Binding Domain 	
Xist	EZH2	a 1 6 kb ncRNA within Xist call RepA be find to bind the Polycomb complex PRC2 EZH2 SUZ12 and EED1 directly 	
Xist	Hrh4	Experiments indicate that histone H3f3a lysine 27 trimethylation H3K27m3 and Hrh4 lysine 20 monomethylation H4K20m1 be associate with Xist expression in undifferentiated ES cell and mark the initiation of X inactivation 	
XIST	BRCA1	BRCA1 associate with XIST RNA 	
Xist	H3f3a	A hotspot of H3f3a Lys-9 methylation situate upstream of Xist likely bind a chromodomain protein 	
Xist	H2afy	Xist RNA might directly interact with H2afy or alternatively Xist RNA might alter chromatin structure in a way that facilitate the recruitment of H2afy 	
Xist	H2afy	H2afy accumulate a MCBs that be associate with Xist RNA signal upon differentiation and concomitant X inactivation 	
XIST	BRCA1	A XIST interacting partner BRCA1 function in DNA damage pathway a a ubiquitin ligase 	
XIST	SRSF1	the ncRNAs represent in the SRSF1 CLIP-seq data be 23 snoRNAs three microRNA precursor and the 5 8S rRNA XIST and MALAT1 RNAs 	
XIST	NXF1	The export factor NXF1 bind poorly to XIST RNA in comparison to export mRNAs suggest that reduce NXF1 binding may contribute to nuclear retention of XIST RNA 	
XIST	BRCA1	Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment have demonstrate that BRCA1 physically associate with XIST RNA 	
Xist	H2afy	These result demonstrate that Xist repression mainly affect H2afy deposition but not H3K27me3 on the Xi of pre-iPSCs
