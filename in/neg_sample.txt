H19	IGF2R	We used reverse transcription-PCR to analyze the allele-specific expression of Igf-2, IGF2R, and H19 in the testes and ovaries of mice derived from an interspecies cross between Mus musculus and Mus spretus
H19	Igf2	allelic methylation patterns in Igf2 and H19 arise early in embryogenesis and change progressively during development
H19	Igf2	This raises the possibility that imprinting of H19 is involved only in the maintenance and not in the initiation of monoallelic expression of Igf2
H19	IGF2	In cervical cancer H19 and IGF2 expressions could be independently regulated
H19	IGF2	IGF2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and H19 is expressed only from the maternal allele
H19	Igf2	the expression of H19 and Igf2 genes is not always from their respective maternal and paternal alleles

H19	Igf2	The imprinting of the Igf2 and Ins2 genes is dependent on the transcription of the downstream H19 gene
H19	Ins2	The imprinting of the Igf2 and Ins2 genes is dependent on the transcription of the downstream H19 gene
H19	Igf2	Igf2 and H19 are part of a larger imprinting region and as a first step,we examined these reciprocally imprinted genes in transgenic experiments using a 130 kb YAC clone
H19	IGF2	Although our results document one instance in which a post neoplastic loss of H19 activity correlates with loss of IGF2 imprinting at the cellular level, it appears that inactivation of H19 is more generally independent of loss of imprinting of IGF2, at least in our specimens 
H19	Igf2	There was no significant change in Igf2 or H19 expression in brain
H19	IGF2	In addition, a lack of correlation between IGF2 and H19 imprinting status suggests that any regional parental imprint has been functionally lost

H19	MYC	None of the 11 RCCs methylated at VHL had evidence of methylation at either CDKN2 or MYC (methylation at CDKN2 was, however, detected in 3 %, or 1/33, of RCCs without VHL methylation) A normal methylation pattern at H19 was demonstrated in the three RCCs with methylated VHL analysed
H19	Igf2	We ruled out the importance of DNA methylation at Igf2 by showing that silencing of Igf2 accompanying the loss of DNA methylation could be overcome by a mutation at the neighboring H19 gene that activates Igf2
H19	Igf2	a transcriptional model involving access to a common set of enhancers shared between Igf2 and H19 is the most likely explanation for Igf2 imprinting
H19	Igf2	For cells of neuroectodermal origin, complete absence of Igf2 and H19 transcription was previously described

H19	Igf2	The linked H19 and Igf2 genes on mouse distal chromosome 7 are subject to genomic imprinting
H19	Igf2	transcriptional activity from the H19 promoter is not required for the imprinted silencing of the Igf2 gene

H19	Igf2	We conclude that the imprints of the H19, U2af1-rs1, and Igf2 genes are maintained in lymphocytes in adult mice
