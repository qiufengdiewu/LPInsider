466	Xist	HNRNPU	RNA-Protein	binding	Xist RNA and hnRNP U interact, and depletion of hnRNP U causes Xist to detach from the Xi and to localize diffusely in the nucleoplasm.	Mouse	Xist; AI314753; A430022B11	NR_001463.3	21925379
467	Xist	PRC2	RNA-Protein	binding	The concentration of PRC2 at the 59 end of Xist is intriguing because recruitment of PRC2 and H3-K27me3 are two of the earliest changes to occur on the X following Xist up-regulation.	Mouse	Xist; AI314753; A430022B11	NR_001463.3	19684108

469	Xist	PRC2	RNA-Protein	binding	During female development, Xist RNA is expressed from the inactive X and coats the X chromosome from which it is transcribed, leading to recruitment of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27 to silence transcription.	Mouse	Xist; AI314753; A430022B11	NR_001463.3	21496640
470	Xist	PRC2	RNA-Protein	binding	X chromosome inactivation requires Xist, an ncRNA that coats the X and recruits Polycomb proteins.	Mouse	Xist; AI314753; A430022B11	NR_001463.3	21029862
471	Xist	PRC2	RNA-Protein	binding	CDK1 and CDK2 phosphorylate EZH2 at threonine 350 (T350) and that T350 phosphorylation is important for the binding of EZH2 to PRC2 recruiters, such as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) HOTAIR and XIST.	Mouse	Xist; AI314753; A430022B11	NR_001463.3	21278485
472	Xist	PRC2	RNA-Protein	Binding	Tsix represses Xist induction by several means, including altering the chromatin state of Xist, deploying Dnmt3a’s DNA methyltransferase activity, recruiting the RNAi machinery, and interfering with the ability of Xist and RepA RNA to engage Polycomb proteins.

475	XIST	TAP/NXF1	RNA-Protein	binding	The export factor TAP/NXF1 binds poorly to XIST RNA in comparison to exported mRNAs, suggesting that reduced TAP/NFX1 binding may contribute to nuclear retention of XIST RNA.	Human	XIST; SXI1; swd66; DXS1089; DXS399E; LINC00001; NCRNA00001	NR_001564.2	17333237
