Loss of imprinting of H19 and IGF-2 was observed in samples of human bladder carcinoma
We used reverse transcription-PCR to analyze the allele-specific expression of Igf-2, IGF2R, and H19 in the testes and ovaries of mice derived from an interspecies cross between Mus musculus and Mus spretus
We used reverse transcription-PCR to analyze the allele-specific expression of Igf-2, IGF2R, and H19 in the testes and ovaries of mice derived from an interspecies cross between Mus musculus and Mus spretus
allelic methylation patterns in Igf2 and H19 arise early in embryogenesis and change progressively during development
This raises the possibility that imprinting of H19 is involved only in the maintenance and not in the initiation of monoallelic expression of Igf2
In cervical cancer H19 and IGF2 expressions could be independently regulated
IGF2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and H19 is expressed only from the maternal allele
the expression of H19 and Igf2 genes is not always from their respective maternal and paternal alleles 
The association of H19 and p95 gene expression in drug resistance warrants further study
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we localized the marsupial homeologues of IGF2 and H19 to the distal part of tammar wallaby chromosome 2p and the marsupial homeologues of SNRPN and ZNF127 to the middle of chromosome 1q
Among WTs without LOH most cases with H19 inactivation also have reduced KIP2 expression and most cases with persistent H19 expression have high levels of KIP2 mRNA
This gene is homologous to yeast nucleosome assembly protein (NAP1) and to a human homologue of NAP1, and we designate it hNAP2 (human nucleosome assembly protein 2) hNAP2 diverges in its expression pattern from IGF2, H19, and p57KIP2, and it shows biallelic expression in all tissues tested 
We previously described biallelic expression of L23MRP, 40 kb downstream of H19
Parallel expression of H19 and TNNT3 in different adult skeletal muscle types suggests that these genes may share an enhancer 
While IGF2 presumably plays a role in tumorigenesis of Wilms' tumor, H19 is not expressed in the majority of Wilms' tumors
The imprinting of the Igf2 and Ins2 genes is dependent on the transcription of the downstream H19 gene
The imprinting of the Igf2 and Ins2 genes is dependent on the transcription of the downstream H19 gene
Igf2 and H19 are part of a larger imprinting region and as a first step,we examined these reciprocally imprinted genes in transgenic experiments using a 130 kb YAC clone
Although our results document one instance in which a post neoplastic loss of H19 activity correlates with loss of IGF2 imprinting at the cellular level, it appears that inactivation of H19 is more generally independent of loss of imprinting of IGF2, at least in our specimens 
There was no significant change in Igf2 or H19 expression in brain
In addition, a lack of correlation between IGF2 and H19 imprinting status suggests that any regional parental imprint has been functionally lost 
We characterize a 800-kb region on the distal end of mouse chromosome 7 that contains a cluster of four maternally expressed genes, H19, Mash2, Kvlqt1, and p57(Kip2), as well as two paternally expressed genes, Igf2 and Ins2, and assess the expression and imprinting of Mash2, Kvlqt1, and p57(Kip2) during development in embryonic and extraembryonic tissues

H19 and Igf2 are located within a large imprinting domain that confers monoallelic silencing of parental alleles
Therefore, we analysed methylation of the VHL, CDKN2, MYC, and H19 genes in primary RCC samples
Therefore, we analysed methylation of the VHL, CDKN2, MYC, and H19 genes in primary RCC samples
Therefore, we analysed methylation of the VHL, CDKN2, MYC, and H19 genes in primary RCC samples
None of the 11 RCCs methylated at VHL had evidence of methylation at either CDKN2 or MYC (methylation at CDKN2 was, however, detected in 3 %, or 1/33, of RCCs without VHL methylation) A normal methylation pattern at H19 was demonstrated in the three RCCs with methylated VHL analysed

We ruled out the importance of DNA methylation at Igf2 by showing that silencing of Igf2 accompanying the loss of DNA methylation could be overcome by a mutation at the neighboring H19 gene that activates Igf2
a transcriptional model involving access to a common set of enhancers shared between Igf2 and H19 is the most likely explanation for Igf2 imprinting
For cells of neuroectodermal origin, complete absence of Igf2 and H19 transcription was previously described
Apart from the ventral midline region, H19 and Igf2 were found to be coexpressed in the ectodermally derived Rathke's pouch and in some circumventricular organs of the brain
As with other RNA polymerase III transcripts, La protein binds with high affinity to the 3' end of BC200 RNA
These data indicate that IGF2, but not H19, is prone to loss of imprinting in breast cancer
These data suggest that LOI at H19 and IGF2 also may be common in pediatric testicular GCTs
Interestingly, the same experiments performed in BT-20 cell line provided very similar results as those obtained in MCF-7 cells, with a clear down-regulation mediated by PR-A on the H19 promoter 
The linked H19 and Igf2 genes on mouse distal chromosome 7 are subject to genomic imprinting
transcriptional activity from the H19 promoter is not required for the imprinted silencing of the Igf2 gene
Loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF-II and H19 has been suggested to be an early oncogenic event in cancerogenesis 
In contrast to previous reports, we could document only one case rising from germ cells by meiosis-II nondisjunction H19 and SNRPN were methylated in individual teratomas to various degrees, ranging from normal somatic cell to expected ovum levels
Degrees of H19 hypomethylation and SNRPN hypermethylation increased as the cellular origin of the tumors advanced in oogenesis and were closely correlated in individual teratomas
Although lymphocytes do not express H19 and Igf2, both genes are reactivated in a proper monoallelic manner in hybrid cells 
We conclude that the imprints of the H19, U2af1-rs1, and Igf2 genes are maintained in lymphocytes in adult mice 
We conclude that the imprints of the H19, U2af1-rs1, and Igf2 genes are maintained in lymphocytes in adult mice

These results raise the possibility that a defective modifier or regulatory gene unlinked to 11p15.5 caused a spectrum of epigenetic alterations in the germ line or early development of both cousins, ranging from the relaxation of IGF2 imprinting in the KTWS proband to disruption of both the imprinted expression of IGF2 and the imprinted methylation of KvDMR1 in the BWS proband

Together, our data show that NEAT1 plays an important role in the innate immune response through the transcriptional regulation of antiviral genes by the stimulus-responsive cooperative action of NEAT1 and SFPQ
Therefore, we aimed to study the expression of the INK4/ARF locus genes CDKN2A and CDKN2BAS in order to examine the p16(INK4a) protein expression and the level of cell proliferation in carotid plaques and saphenous tissue samples A total of 50 patients(33 symptomatic subjects and 17 asymptomatic subjects) with carotid atherosclerosis CA) were studied
In RNA immunoprecipitation assays, linc-POU3F3 was associated with the EZH2 messenger RNA (mRNA)
The normal monoallelic expression of the imprinted genes H19, Snrpn and Kcnq1ot1 was unaffected in either the placentae or the embryos from the superovulated females at E145 or E185

Together, these results suggest that p53 -regulated TUG1 is a growth regulator, which acts in part through control of HOXB7
These findings indicate that lincRNA-p21 affects global gene expression and influences the p53 tumor suppressor pathway by acting in cis as a locus-restricted coactivator for p53-mediated p21 expression
Finally, MEG3 activated p53 in OVCAR3 cells
In proliferating cells, we found that hnRNPA1 binds and destabilizes CDKN2A mRNA whereas during senescence, UCA1 sequesters hnRNPA1 and thus stabilizes CDKN2A
When the expression of FOXCUT was down-regulated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), the expression of FOXC1 was also decreased
The interaction between LEF1NAT, miR-544a, and PTEN was probed using bioinformatical analysis and dual-luciferase assay

Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed that CTXND1 overexpression inhibited nuclear translocation of YAP, by inducing MST1 expression and promoting phosphorylation of LATS1 and YAP, consequently downregulating the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins (MCM7 and cyclin D1)
Further, analysis of the promoter of HOTAIR, revealed that STAT3 could potentially regulate the activity of the HOTAIR in cervical cancer cells and inhibition of STAT3 had similar effects on the proliferation, migration and invasion of the cervical cancer cells as that of HOTAIR
Further, the suppression of STAT3 expression was associated with concomitant downregulation of IncRNA HOTAIR as indicated by the qRT-PCR
Deletion of heightened HULC erased the cells growth accelerated following low dose irradiation exposure CDKN1, the neighbor gene of HULC, was down-regulated by overexpression of HULC following low dose irradiation exposure via complementary base pairing, resulting in promoting cell cycle process
